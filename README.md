# PulseHR: AI-Powered HRMS with Blockchain Verification

PulseHR is a comprehensive Human Resource Management System designed to streamline workforce management through automated performance analysis and secure task verification. The platform integrates Google Gemini AI for advanced analytics and Blockchain technology for immutable work logging.

## Core Workflow

The application follows a structured workflow for both administrative and employee roles:

### Administrative Workflow
1. **Organization Onboarding**: Administrators register their organization to create a secure tenant environment.
2. **Employee Management**: Administrators add employees to the system, assigning them roles, departments, and skills.
3. **Task Management**: Administrators create and assign tasks to specific employees, setting priorities and deadlines.
4. **AI Performance Analysis**: Administrators access the AI Insights module to view productivity scores and skill gap analyses generated by Gemini AI.

### Employee Workflow
1. **Secure Access**: Employees log in using credentials provided by the administrator.
2. **Task Execution**: Employees view their assigned tasks and update statuses from "Assigned" to "In Progress" or "Completed."
3. **Blockchain Verification**: Upon completion of a task, employees have the option to connect their MetaMask wallet and cryptographically sign the completion, creating an immutable record of work.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Components
The frontend is built with React and Vite, utilizing a modular component architecture:

- **AuthContext**: A React Context provider that manages the global authentication state, role-based access control, and session persistence.
- **Sidebar**: A persistent navigation component for the administrative dashboard, providing access to different modules.
- **Dashboard**: The primary landing page for administrators, displaying high-level organizational statistics and trends.
- **Employees**: A comprehensive management interface for creating, updating, and deactivating employee records.
- **Tasks**: An administrative interface for task creation, assignment, and status monitoring.
- **EmployeePortal**: A dedicated environment for employees to manage their individual task lists and interact with the Web3 integration.
- **AIInsights**: A specialized analytics dashboard featuring two primary modules:
    - **Productivity Scoring**: Visualizes employee performance data and Gemini AI summaries.
    - **Skill Gap Detection**: Analyzes workforce competencies against role requirements.
- **Auth Pages (Login/Register)**: Secure interfaces for user authentication and organization registration.

### Backend API Routes
The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, providing a RESTful API for all system operations:

- **Auth Routes (`/api/auth`)**
    - `POST /register`: Organization registration.
    - `POST /login-admin`: Administrative authentication.
    - `POST /login-employee`: Employee authentication.
    - `GET /me`: Current user session retrieval.
    - `POST /logout`: Session termination.
- **Employee Routes (`/api/employees`)**
    - `GET /`: Retrieve all employees for the organization.
    - `POST /`: Add a new employee.
    - `PUT /:id`: Update employee details.
    - `DELETE /:id`: Deactivate employee record.
- **Task Routes (`/api/tasks`)**
    - `GET /`: Retrieve tasks (filtered by role).
    - `POST /`: Create and assign a new task.
    - `PATCH /:id/status`: Update task status and store blockchain transaction hashes.
    - `DELETE /:id`: Remove a task.
- **AI Routes (`/api/ai`)**
    - `GET /productivity`: Rule-based scoring integrated with Gemini AI performance summaries.
    - `GET /skill-gap`: Workforce competency analysis with Gemini AI training recommendations.
- **Dashboard Routes (`/api/dashboard`)**
    - `GET /stats`: Organizational metrics and status breakdowns.

## Integration Details

### Artificial Intelligence Integration
PulseHR utilizes the **Google Generative AI (Gemini Pro)** model to provide qualitative insights on top of quantitative data. The system sends structured performance and skill data to the Gemini API, which returns natural language summaries, performance reviews, and actionable training suggestions.

### Web3 and Blockchain Integration
The platform implements workforce logging through **Ethereum-compatible message signing**:
- **MetaMask Connectivity**: The application interfaces with the MetaMask browser extension via `ethers.js`.
- **Cryptographic Proof**: When a task is marked as completed, the employee signs a unique message containing task metadata.
- **Data Integrity**: The resulting signature (transaction hash) is stored in the database, providing a non-repudiable audit trail of work completion.

## Deployment and Setup

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Ethers.js.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, JWT, Bcrypt.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon.tech).
- **Hosting**: Recommended Vercel (Frontend) and Render/Railway (Backend).

### Initial Configuration
To set up the environment, the following variables must be configured in the backend `.env` file:
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string.
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: API key from Google AI Studio.
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for token signing.
- `PORT`: Server port (default 5000).
